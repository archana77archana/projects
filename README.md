Do you run an Open Source project? We would love to see you involved in
Rails Girls Summer of Code!

The ideal project for the Rails Girls Summer of Code defines a goal that:

* can be considered a valuable, significant contribution
* is simple enough that beginners will be able to complete it in a time frame of three months or less

A project goal can include anything that helps you: Bug fixing, implementing
small features, documentation, design, etc. Anything that allows the student to
both apply her experience and grow with the challenge.

Also, the goal can consist of several sub-goals or follow-up goals that can be
adjusted to the progress of the student. Coming up with a good definition might
be hard, taking into account that the student's skills are not yet advanced.
Don't be discouraged by that. We will work together with you in order to figure
out a definition that works well.

To start defining your goal, ask yourself: 

What can be done to help a Ruby newcomer become a core contributor on your
project?  Also, consider this to be a learning target. Different from GSoC or
RSoC the RailsGirls Summer of Code is about encouraging, motivating, helping
newcomers to learn and eventually provide valuable, significant contributions.

Projects will be asked to provide a mentor, who will act as experts in the project's
domain, and provide feedback and direction. In their day-to-day work students will
supported by coaches (developers based in the same city as the student, helping
them to accomplish their tasks), so the workload for a mentor is limited.

Register your project now and open a new issue in this repository.
