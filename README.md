# Rails Girls Summer of Code 2014
### Projects Proposals

Do you run an Open Source project? We would love to see you involved in Rails
Girls Summer of Code!

In order to propose a project for this year's Rails Girls Summer of Code please
[open an issue](https://github.com/rails-girls-summer-of-code/projects/issues/new) 
on this repository.

A good project for the Rails Girls Summer of Code defines a goal that:

* can be considered a valuable, significant contribution
* is simple enough that beginners will be able to complete it in a time frame
  of three months or less

A project goal can include anything that helps you: Bug fixing, implementing
small features, refactoring, documentation, design, etc. Anything that allows
the student to both apply her experience and grow with the challenge.

Also, goals can consist of several sub-goals or follow-up goals that can be
adjusted to the progress of the student. Coming up with a good definition might
be hard, taking into account that the student's skills are not yet advanced.
Don't be discouraged by that. We will work together with you in order to figure
out a definition that works well.

To start defining your goal, ask: What can be done to help a Ruby newcomer
become a core contributor on your project? Also, consider this to be a learning
process. Different from GSoC or RSoC the Rails Girls Summer of Code is about
encouraging, motivating, helping newcomers to learn and eventually provide
valuable, significant contributions.

Projects will be asked to provide a mentor, who will act as experts in the
project's domain, and provide feedback and direction. However, in their
day-to-day work students will be supported by coaches (developers based in the
same city as the student, helping them to accomplish their tasks), so the
workload for project mentor is limited.
